# flowsphere
Noise-based flow field in 3d

Requires node.js and npm. Builds with webpack.

1. Download or clone
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Build with:
    - `npm run dev` -> build development (un-minified)
    - `npm run prod` -> build production (minified)
    - `npm run watch` -> build in memory and serve from localhost:8080, open browser with live reloading to see src changes in realtime

Enjoy!
